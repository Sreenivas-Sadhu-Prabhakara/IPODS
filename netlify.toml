#  The redirects below are for SPA (Single Page Apps).
#  For multi-page static sites, normal file resolution is usually enough.
#  However, if you want specific rewrites or redirects they go here.
#  Removing the "/*" to "/index.html" rewrite because this is a MULTI-PAGE site,
#  and we want /services.html to serve services.html, not index.html by default
#  (unless you're incorrectly handling history API, but this is pure HTML).
#
#  If you insist on clean URLs (e.g., /services instead of /services.html), 
#  you can use the "pretty_urls" feature in Netlify settings or enable it here.
